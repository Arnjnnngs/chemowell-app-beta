harness-med-purpose-patch.py -- app-v72. Every medication says what it is for.

Aaron, 2026-09-08: "I've asked before to have something pulled from another site to say what the med
is intended for... it wasn't webMD, it was something else that couldn't sue me for using their
stuff." He was right that it never shipped, and the ask was not written down in ANY of the three
repos -- including this one, whose REQUESTS.md and BACKLOG.md have existed since app-v25.

ON THE SOURCE, because it was his actual worry. What cannot be copied is somebody's PROSE; the fact
that ondansetron prevents nausea is not ownable by anyone. So this ships SHORT ORIGINAL sentences
written for a patient -- nothing copied from WebMD, from a drug label, or from any site -- and the
app cites nothing, because a citation to a document nobody here read would be a lie. US federal
sources (openFDA, DailyMed, MedlinePlus) are public domain and would also have been safe to quote;
every one is blocked by the build sandbox's network policy, which is why the text is original rather
than quoted. Refreshing it to exact federal wording later is a data change into the same table.

WHY THIS DIFFERS FROM care-tracker's v74, WHICH SHIPPED THE SAME DAY. care-tracker has a fixed list
of thirteen medications, so its table is keyed by medication ID. ChemoWell has NO default list --
every user types their own -- so a table keyed by id would match nothing. Here the lookup is by
NAME, and by GENERIC NAME as a fallback, both lowercased and punctuation-stripped, so someone who
types "Zofran" and someone who types "ondansetron" both get the line. What the user typed in the
field always wins over the lookup, and a medication nobody recognises simply shows nothing.

WHAT IT DOES
  * MED_PURPOSE: one plain sentence per commonly-prescribed medication, keyed by lowercase name.
  * purposeOf(med): typed field > lookup on name > lookup on generic > '' (never an empty label).
  * "What it's for" is a real field in the medication editor, optional, free text.
  * The Meds screen shows it under the generic name, with ONE disclaimer above the list.
  * medicationFormFrom() carries the field, so editing a medication cannot silently wipe it. That is
    care-tracker's v43.3 failure class and this app has the identical seeder shape.
  * THE BUILT-IN LINE IS A PLACEHOLDER, NEVER A SEEDED VALUE. care-tracker's v74 seeded it as a
    value and the Zero Day Audit blocked that build twice over from the one root cause: clearing the
    box and saving did NOTHING while the app said "updated", so a line someone believed was wrong
    could be overwritten but never removed; and saving ANY edit froze that day's wording into the
    user's stored config, so a later correction would never reach a medication anyone had edited.
    Unset stays unset, typing overrides, clearing returns to the built-in line, nothing freezes.
    The placeholder is resolved from the NAME BEING TYPED, so it appears as soon as a recognised
    medication name is entered on a brand-new medication.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
  * Nothing on the Home quick-log cards -- that is the screen a patient taps when they feel awful,
    and every extra line sits between them and the dose button.
  * No runtime fetch. A live lookup would send a user's medication list to a third-party server and
    would fail exactly when they are offline. The text is in the file.
  * No dose, no schedule, no advice. Only what the medication is generally for.

Usage:  python3 harness-med-purpose-patch.py [--base <index.html>] [--out index.html]
The version stamp lives INSIDE this patch: it refuses a base that is not app-v71 and emits app-v72.
